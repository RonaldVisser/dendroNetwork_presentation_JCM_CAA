## Research

### Research context: Roman wood provision

- Many finds of wood from Roman period
- Archaeological context known
- Provenance of wood unknown

### Main research question
- How was the procurement of wood organised in the German provinces of the Roman empire during first four centuries AD? 

## Dendrochronology

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Annual ring of wood around tree
- Tree ring width depends on
  - Soil
  - (micro)Climate
  - Local factors
  - Disturbance
- Growth season: spring and summer

## Dendroprovenance

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

Provenance of wood based on comparison tree-ring curves with calenders

### Problems
- Often based on single measure
- Comparison individual curves
- Complex with large datasets
- Clustering problems common interval

### Solution: network analyses

## Dendrochronological networks

- Nodes: Site chronologies (tree ring data) 
- Edges: statistical similarity
  - Correlation (r ≥  0,5)
  - Overlapping tree rings (n ≥ 50)
  - SGC (% (Improved statistic, formerly Gleichläufigkeit: ≥ 70%)
  - Probability of exceedence (p, <= 0.0001)

## rOpenSci

- Creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web

- Making the right data, tools and best practices more discoverable

- Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community

- Promoting advocacy for a culture of data sharing and reusable software

- Building capacity of software users and developers and fostering a sense of pride in their work

## Package: Creating functions

- Converting scripts to functions

## Package: Creating documentation

- Manual pages
- Wirti

## Package: Creating tests

## Package: Review

## Package: Dissemination

## Conclusions + recommendations

- Be nice, and share and document your code!
- Develop functions not scripts.
- Develop a package from the start, especially when devising a new method(ology).
- Read the documentation (or: RTFM)
- Submit to rOpenSci and enjoy!
